He said, "Thank you for everything you've said."
Yeah, sure.
Yes, yes, I'm leaving now.

I went to that uncle's house, and he...
My uncle's been standing there waiting for me.
I've never been to my uncle and aunt's.
When it's so cool out there...
The stones got very cold.
You couldn't feel the coldest river in the world.
The spirits ate raw meat.
I burned the peppers in the fire.
Go to that river and take a bath with that pepper.
You'll have to wipe it with that white cloth.
After I wiped the dishes...
After we dry the water all over the body...
My father is a great hunter.
No matter how much their parents told them, they went there and played.
My mother and father loved their children very much.
I don't know why the dog bit the bird and ate it.
He jumped on a deer at once.
The first person to be dedicated to the spirit was the spirit.
I'm sick. I'm sick. I'm sick.
It's a scratch. It's a scratch.
He's got it on him, he's got it on him, he's got it on him, he's got it on him, he's got it on him, he's got it on him, he's got it on him, he's got it on him, he's got it on him, he's got it on him, he's got it on him.
I'm embarrassed.
He was so ashamed to leave.
You'll be punished.
You guys, don't hit this dog again.
(Laughter)
You can go around looking for him in the middle of the night.
He looked back from there.
We've been walking all the way to the Chinese Zinan Province.
I'll mix them with ash.
I accidentally mixed it with white and black.
She always tried to match the drug with her mother-in-law.
People who can fix cars.
We're going to have to close down for two weeks to make progress.
I'm so grateful to you.
He was carrying a lot of sponges.
I'm so tired.
There's more girls in their house.
The sun's getting warmer.
He's become more beautiful than the rest of the birds.
Women who are trying are more powerful than men.
So that the people will live on forever.
A country that has been able to last to this day.
I want the country to stay strong.
- Up tawn da let the whole village surround itself
It's been a long time since we've had this kind of global warming, and it's been a long time since we've seen it.
I have to give it to the neighbor.
The perimeter of their house.
The nine villages around it.
That's where the river is narrowed.
You keep your eyes narrow seven times.
I've never been to a place where the river in Mari River narrows down.
I tied this elephant to that tree.
He's been tied to the trunk of a large tree in a long nine square feet.
I tied his hair to a stump and...
I've been running that car for years.
They took the bike on the boat.
The sun fell again at night.
I don't see the sun.
It's very hot.
She's my wife.
His wife is a dragon girl.
When the old woman wakes up from her dreams...
It's been 80 years.
10 ing j re shaloi
After 6:00 a.m.
Then the horse pulled out the corner and gave it to him.
It turns red when you put shrimp in the fire.
You're very strong.
He screamed out loud.
It's very hot today.
It's because the peppers are so hard.
Make the japs to make them taste so delicious.
It's not sweet, it's not bitter.
I don't know what I'm talking about, but I can't tell you what I'm talking about.
You'll grow in your knowledge.
I added that it was God who said it.
And that's what we're trying to do.
I've broken all my clothes.
We ripped it apart and ate it.
I ripped all my pants off.
The guards of the gates welcomed him and looked him up.
When I checked with someone who bit my cat...
Open your stomach and see what's in it.
True peace.
Real independence.
They don't give us a real democracy, they don't give us a real democracy.
I've served my grandfather. I've served my spirits.
I'm going to provide you with an ancestor.
Our grandfathers.
I'm sorry.
From the time of my grandparents.
I'm not tired of it yet.
I'm tired of waiting.
Don't you get tired of eating here all the time?
That's their cousin's girl.
My friend Waterbird, I'd like to ask you for help.
He's made friends with the tiger.
That's what we're supposed to do. That's what we're supposed to do. That's what we're supposed to do. That's what we're supposed to do.
I speak Jin-Pon.
I don't know what you're talking about, but I don't know what you're talking about.
Goats have to pee very hard.
Your brother's pissing.
Because of diabetes.
Are you sure I'm right?
I thought I was right.
It's true. It's true.
I used a bottle of water to pour water into that soprano.
He waters the flowers there.
Even if the trees don't have anyone to water them...
They built a house together to live in.
The monkeys carried him with them.
I hit it with my hand, and I opened it, and it was full of stones.
Get on this horse and go home to the house.
Get on the boat.
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about how it's possible for the Mari River to expand within 24 hours.
He went to school.
Classrooms, places to study.
That kid climbs that tree when he leaves school.
I'll cook for the students.
The students said yes.
He taught students how to study in the morning and in the evening.
How much money do I have to pay the thieves?
I need your permission to see my child.
I have no food to feed you.
Let's get some pork and eat it.
Let's get some fish.
I left that bell on fire.
You put water in it, you mix it with salt, and then you mix it with...
There's sugar in it.
A fish that was dried with salt.
You held my bones.
Hold on to this rope.
What he took turned into money.
I'll put down the base.
We're going to build a base in the concordat.
To build the memorial stone.
I saw it at the edge of my eyes.
I was waiting in the corner of the door.
There was a banana tree growing in the west corner of his house.
My brother died with no money.
The drugs that humans use.
Use the money you've got where you want it.
It's very early in the morning.
That dog came too early.
Early hours, early hours, early hours, early hours, early hours, early hours, early hours, early hours, early hours, early hours, early hours.
You destroyed the hive.
I threw the fruit away.
You scared the crows.
Sweet as honey.
Salt water of the sea.
Drink the wine that I mixed.
A snake in nine mountains.
Nine, ten years have passed.
- Ding kaba, a large pond joined by nine streams.
Put your name on this list.
I'm looking into the guest list.
I explained to him the books on the money I used.
When I saw you again in the morning,
In the morning. In the morning.
I've had breakfast.
Western border.
The border between China and the state of Katin.
Transmigration
I'm washing rice.
After cleaning up and cleaning up...
He cleaned this cage.
Let's have a little chat with our friends.
I went by the river, sat down, and chatted.
We've been talking about Myanmar's problems.
He destroyed this house.
You destroyed all my mountains.
I set fire to all the settlements and destroyed them.
To end your sin.
It's not good to end a very important time without it.
Finally, the orphan won.
He cried so hard.
He called out to the elephant, the elephant, the elephant.
The screaming.
You dropped a bomb on a plane.
I locked up a friend of mine.
I dropped him in the river.
I need you to keep this man here.
I took a little rest there.
The two of them often fought each other.
He shot a pachinko and scared her.
And that's what I'm talking about.
You scared a friend of a liar.
I don't know what I'm talking about. I don't know what I'm talking about. I don't know what I'm talking about.
Have you recovered your cough?
Coughing hasn't been cured yet.
So I need to see your mother.
God must have brought us together.
No one's ever letting him see anything lower than him.
Smart orphan.
Very poor orphan.
I know you owe me, orphan.
The wolf got sick.
I met a wolf.
You're a lying wolf.
I would beat the drums and dance.
I danced to the dance of Tonka.
The sick got up and danced.
I wrote his name on it.
To his children.
I wrote my opinion and spread it.
Opium is a terrible thing. It's something to be expected.
Those who smoke opium can't help but drink tea.
In the opium field.
I believe in my wife.
People who believe in God.
What religion do you believe in?
You have to trust me.
He believes in God.
The faith of the old days.
With this money, you can do whatever you want.
I don't want to.
I don't want to work.
My stomach hurts.
I made the money I got from that vegetable garden as a food for my life.
The frogs are hungry too.
Ants are on your body.
He's possessed by a spirit.
Cats are talented so they can live with people in their homes.
From that day on,
The tree will produce fruit.
Dogs have always been very loyal.
He climbed onto the hill where they only lived.
The hill of the cemetery.
I went to that mountain to pick up the trees.
You can live here as you please from now on.
I don't know where you went.
You go inside.
He was looking for where my mother was standing.
I don't know where my friends have gone.
I'm not sure why, so I sent his kids out to look at it.
All the adults in the village.
Knowledge is ripe.
The mother cow is mature.
We will honor my father.
I praised him and served him.
To honor and praise the Lord.
It's a sign of God.
Using the Mark of Manau.
There was no pattern on the old Manau column.
I gave him a gift.
I gave him a gift.
I only got this horse as a gift.
You've left your home...
The tiger will eat me.
Give me that position.
I avoid you.
I don't drink. I don't drink.
Avoid conflict as much as you can.
There's a lot of people out there.
He made a few mistakes.
You're gonna have to take a little bit of it.
Grandpa, when you carry it, don't try to open it up a little bit in the street.
She had very long hair.
That's where I tied my hair.
Sal's grandfather had his hair combed.
I went and asked for help.
He's not an angel.
Let's call one of the judges for the trial.
Every single one of us.
I've set a good example for those in charge.
Just like you saw in the example.
The mountain people in Myanmar.
I'm thinking in his mind.
He fled into that forest.
He said he ran into a smart guy on his way home.
Most of them were eaten that way.
He was hit in the head.
A little church made out of bamboo.
Everything that's growing in the trees.
We're running out of trees in this time of the year.
There's a bad, savage heart in our hearts.
Think about it again in your mind.
Your heart is so pure.
When I turned 16,
I've done it six or seven times.
These two were given six boys.
The kite got softer.
It's very soft.
I'm a little more relaxed now that I've taught you knowledge.
He prayed every night.
Why don't you pray for me?
I've been praying, "May God bless you."
It's a very bitter kind of leaf.
It's a bitter taste in the flesh.
It was so salty again.
So he went on to learn.
Study, learn.
You have to learn to understand one lesson better.
It's very difficult.
No matter how difficult it is...
I'm here to help my brother when he's in trouble.
How are you?
She's fine. She's very beautiful.
The students are healthy and healthy.
I slept around a tree trunk.
He walked around the mountain looking for the trees and the medicine.
The pigs around the village where the tigers attack so much.
One of the dogs went with him.
He went after his brother.
We have to obey the law.
The king who rules the country.
You've accepted what your friend did.
My grandfather welcomed us brothers.
They ambushed us and shot us when the soldiers came up.
I need some water.
I went out and played with the water.
When I was bathing,
They broke up with their friends.
From that day on, they were separated.
I can distinguish between what's good and what's bad.
Two children who went to bathe were drowned.
I'm here because I want to get baptized.
I'm going to give you a couple of examples.
Let's help each other.
We have to thank each other.
They don't know each other.
The lion has become king of the animals.
It's a very elegant royal palace.
The queen gave her wisdom again.
It's so far. I'm very tired when I walk.
There's a fish swimming in that river down there.
The sun has set, so I couldn't make it on the boat.
I went to the woods and traveled.
I didn't even take him outside.
Sing a song.
I could sing so much.
I was singing, I was dancing, I was singing, I was dancing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was dancing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing, I was singing,
I don't know what to do.
Don't ever do that to me again.
I don't know what I'm talking about, but I don't know what I'm talking about, I don't know what I'm talking about.
Mother.
Your face, your body, it's all the same.
The hawks that feed on corpses, the meat of their bodies.
You're an orphan. Don't cry.
Don't be afraid.
Don't shoot yet.
That you forbade me to take that stone.
People.
There's all kinds of frogs in the lake.
The house is full of toys.
There are 22 bedrooms and 22 bedrooms in the house.
(Laughter)
On the day of the 20th,
He respects people.
Our brothers must honor each other.
The whole village feared him and respected him.
That's why they got married.
I'll marry you both.
Now, the subject of the story I tell you...
That's what grandmothers used to say.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be here.
We have to plant a banana tree near there.
We don't have land to live on.
Let's go do business together.
They were very close friends.
(Laughter)
I'm very tired of cultivating the fields.
I've grown rice and I'm making bread for myself.
I plowed the fields with cattle.
It's been a month since I borrowed the money.
I'll borrow the board.
The man who lent you this rice.
All the young men who got hurt.
It turns out we've had more than 20 people hurt.
It turns out the village was involved in the death of four people.
We've got these guests here, and we've got them.
I'd be happy to welcome you.
There's no one to welcome me out.
I went to a very deep valley and he drank water.
When I reached the valley of one of those mountains up there,
Go to that lower valley and draw water.
Let's make it so clean.
The crows have turned black to this day.
This horse has fed us all our crops.
I'm so glad I can't say it.
Very good.
The power's still out there, so...
Let's do what we have to do about ourselves.
We don't have to cross the other side.
I really want to go to the other side of the river.
The Great Mountain on the east coast over there.
The bird's shape is larger than the goose's.
Your sister-in-law looks like you.
It's like all ethnic independent forces are turning into border guards.
I heard him cry.
I'm gonna cry a lot.
The sound of my mother and sister crying.
It doesn't even fall off the leaves.
The people who came down from the top of the mountain.
The Namsan River flows by the village of Namsan.
My nephew, Bok.
Whose child are you?
My nephew, why don't you live in the village?
It's very sour.
Every day, I've made this stuff sour.
Don't touch our sour fruit.
He's been resting there for a while.
This horse stopped at your house.
After a while, when the sun set, he took in only water again.
The spirits were afraid of the thunder.
My husband's so scared.
For the species of little birds, fear is something to be afraid of.
He agreed.
He couldn't figure it out, no matter how much I told him.
It's been a long time since the sun's land...
It wasn't easy to get rich.
His body wasn't warm enough.
The grass is dead. The flowers are gone.
The creeks and the great rivers have dried up and dried up.
The summer crops dried up and died.
This country's been set afire.
The village's burning smoke.
All his houses and property were burned together.
You're gonna have to eat a lot of food.
When he comes to eat and fill his stomach...
He said he was full because he could eat and drink without ever getting tired.
Who do you want to meet?
About ten students were arrested.
The judge who got his wallet stolen.
The people who were praised.
This woman came back to life again.
Whatever it is, if my child is still alive, that's enough.
He's gone on a trip.
The sun went down on the journey, and it got dark.
I'll take responsibility for all the expenses of my journey.
I didn't even know what to do with it.
He said he'd seen a snake before he'd even been there.
I accidentally stepped on a lion.
I'm gonna wash his clothes.
They've been washing their heads.
They say she's a woman who works washing clothes in a rich man's house.
I'm the only one who didn't.
There were only three girls.
I just hit him and he died.
To save lives.
If you want to help me, you have to keep one of the ropes.
To release the Lord Jesus Christ.
The day we called people together to cut off the fields.
A man who cuts fields and makes a living.
Cut down trees, cut down forests, set the fields on fire, and...
I want to eat the snow.
It's snowing today, so I'm not going to school.
The Chaucan Pass on that border of India is at the foot of a very cold snowstorm.
My mother's already getting ready for dinner.
When they tried to escape,
In the morning, the sun was coming up.
The monkey's ass has turned red.
The one in the red.
An old man with white hair and yellow teeth.
You won't even buy me shoes.
Put your shoes on your feet.
When I went to see the marks on his shoes,
There's a lot of rivers in that village.
Until the day of death.
There's dog shit in the hole.
The buffalo was shitting in the water.
When that bird did shit there, it wasn't shit, it was always money.
What time is it?
I slept until 10:00 p.m.
Forty-five thousand.
Give me a thousand yen.
I think it's about 5,000.
Wait for me.
I've been waiting for a girl friend.
I'll be waiting for you to arrive.
That man, he's been so hard on...
The boy brought the flowers back.
The merchants were always on that path.
The man didn't say anything.
I'll call the men and the women.
I hear this boy has grown to love the King's daughter very much.
Get some rest.
You're welcome.
It's my responsibility to have a cow.
I saw one very special thing.
This house's wartling sound is very special.
Let's eat some special food.
A bacteriological war with weapons.
We don't have to launch weapons.
Small and small guns and weapons.
God's special love.
I made this special for the Lord.
A specially invited Japanese judge.
You're all scared of snakes. You shouldn't leave them on the road.
When I find out he's his real child...
If you don't use that drug, you can't fool me.
I said, take that piece of wood.
She was carrying her mother, and she wasn't going to let her child go.
Water birds have laid a lot of eggs.
The crows became jealous because this waterbird egg was growing.
Two cows were fighting again.
Northeast District
The first district and the second district, especially, live in squirrels.
After arriving in the Manklin district of Michiner...
What's in it?
They've been at the festival all night.
A large village in 100 families.
You'll go to my brothers tomorrow and help them.
Two months later, the chief of the upper class died together in the war.
The parrot escaped from the fence.
The horse was in the horse's pen.
I opened the door to that iron fence.
He's run away from them again.
I ran so fast that I could save their lives.
Let me see.
Let's go play.
He knew everything, didn't he?
One went down there.
The mother of the turtles down there in the lake.
The people who drive the cattle car.
I'll ride in the carriage.
The people on the bikes.
She died crying with her mother.
I made a living cultivating the fields.
I was very happy to go back to that house.
Bees could get away on their leaves like ships.
I've seen a little bit of Hong Kong from the airport.
It's heavy.
It's heavy enough.
Bring that tree's very heavy...
I'm sorry.
Mr. Ramram Gum, who's in charge.
That's why the birds are responsible for waking up the humans, opening the doors of the day.
She got a very beautiful name.
I was able to sleep last night.
I couldn't sleep at night.
My brother got rich.
The family got very rich.
Worked hard, tired to death, didn't grow rich.
People with warm hands.
Get some warm sleep.
He went up that mountain again.
He went up to that very high place up there.
One day, he and his friends went upstream.
He was able to dig a jade...
I got one of those jades.
He told me that people would look at him with their money and their jasper, and he was so desperate to hide it.
This wife died in the water.
He buried the golden pot he had stolen in the trunk of a banana tree.
He slept in the grave.
I took a pill of my type.
Very good food.
I put a lot of food in there.
They ate all my food.
Give me some food.
A long time ago. A long time ago.
A very large buffalo has passed by.
It's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just...
I've been fighting since 1961.
He read a book.
I wrote a letter to the kid who gave him chicken.
He wasn't interested anymore in studying.
People who care about linguistic literature.
The Ginpopo Cultural Society.
I'm going to talk about language literature.
The distant relatives arrived quickly.
They were in a hurry to...
Hurry up with the work you have to do.
I went to the house of the rich and I did my job.
There was one very rich man.
It's not that easy.
It's easy for children to remember.
It's not easy to get independence.
I went to where the stream was flowing.
The Uru River went up the other side of the mountain.
It's Sunday. It's Sunday.
29 Lanan ya shani rai ngai
I didn't go to church on Sundays, I didn't rest, I didn't work.
In the old days, I didn't wear a lonsy.
Put your old clothes on again.
He took off his clothes at one tree.
The history of Lake Indo.
(Laughter)
It's a place of history.
It doesn't make any sense.
Words that don't make sense.
I'm sorry.
It's not too wide.
After building a village on a large plot of land...
One vast river blocked their mother and child.
That's how I raised two children.
No one could figure out how.
We have to use the perfect method.
(Laughter)
To this day.
The season's gone, too.
He's Indian. He's got long noses.
He's got nosebleeds.
Elephant's nose hole.
I married another man.
I can't do anything else.
There are no other descendants.
It's a bee.
Bees have five eyes.
There's no honey in the hive.
His father ran for his life.
That horse can run very well.
I'm a very fast rabbit.
I've accidentally licked an elephant's foot.
I walked.
The village at the foot of the mountain.
The kid wasn't very loose.
The birds were so bored that they rang early in the morning.
You must be tired of reading.
I stole a piece of wood from a house.
He's saying he saw him steal it.
They both sneaked into the medium's house.
I burned it in a tong. I burned it in a fire.
I'm gonna grab that crab with an iron tong and...
I put an iron scissors on the fire.
My mother hit me with a branch.
He was stuck in a branch of a tree.
Lapa is one of the big linjis...
To move forward.
The next day, I walked again.

The chiefs collect taxes...
I got 8,000 aura rahkawn ya la rui ai
I can gather six young men...
(Laughter)
He's the only two of us.
Once a chicken is heard, it has to get up, and once a bird is heard, it has to finish making rice.
I need you to get me one of those ships.
To prepare food for them.
How the two of them cared for and treated, it wasn't easy to heal.
The house that was destroyed by the storm can't be repaired.
Why don't you let him eat something?
Let's do something about the job, both of us.
If you wanted to treat your child and me, I would be jealous.
300 - AD 100 Raman aten hta

I've done one night program.
Whether you go to this festival or not...
There was a program to compete with it.
To that sky above.
The spirits of the Heavens danced to Manau.
I walked around to see how wide the heavens are.
You'll break my nails.
He's got a very long fingernail.
He said there was a tiger claws in one of his bags.
One night, when I slept in that forest,
They had a dream one night.
One night, one night, as late as...
One day, they went fishing.
One day, he went back to the field...
That child grew up one day a day.
About a year or two.
One year, I had a child.
One year, one year.
I only have one child.
I gave him one bow gift.
Let's go to a teacher and ask him.
It smells like snakes.
I burned the snake's skin.
Mom, the snake just swallowed me up, and now I'm at the back of my ankle.
I came back to live in the middle of that river.
They said there was a big river between them.
This leaf will pick it up between December and January.
He's got a shoulder on him. He's got a shoulder on him. He's got a shoulder on him. He's got a shoulder on him.
I'll carry them on the shoulders of my disciples.
He had a bullet in his shoulder and stomach.
I broke his arm.
Put me to bed with your arm.
You're being treated with a wound to your right arm.
My knees were shaking.
Deep mud to the knee.
I'm going to put my head in two laps.
My mother is a Lapai, too.
We're Condus, Mr. Lapide.
Lapi Gum, La Pie No, La Pie La La, there were three of them.
He's very thin.
They've lost weight.
He's very thin.
I hit him with my hand.
You can only choose one.
If you have a wife, raise your hand.
From caterpillars to butterflies.
This worm eats leaves very much, doesn't it?
I took the worm out of this tree.
Wolves can be up there.
Mount Nmine, up on the Posey Mountain.
Take a look up there, called upstream.
My wife's in, Latoe's wife's in.
My mother was of the Lato...
He took a woman from Latoe.
If I give you 100 bucks...
I'm sorry.
I came back to you on the day you counted 100...
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Make dinner quick.
Come on, let's get down to the bottom.
I jumped downstairs in surprise.
You're older than me, brothers.
We're going down to the lowlands.
Once upon a time, I lived in plain country cultivating rice fields.
When we came down to the flat,
Let's go back to the flat.
The one who got the gold bowl.
I'm gonna blow the fire with it.
That very big bird looked at me with his wings.
He cut off one of his fingers.
My thumb moved.
I'm sorry.
That tree's a little too far away.
Rats and cats look a little alike.
The male goat has grown a little old.
One horse gave birth to a child.
After he went up the river...
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
You can go there too.
He sang and danced.
This people didn't have the ability to plant much rice.
Let's go reap the rice now.
A rice mill is a mill that makes rice.
A bird came up to me as I was drying rice...
He doesn't look the same.
When he held the child in his arms, it was a mess.
I made dinner in front of my wife.
The village of Hutte, Bamor.
He's from Bamor.
Everyone knows the Bamor people.
I went and buried the body.
He shot and killed a dead-eating hawk.
He's wearing a white suit to wear on a corpse.
There's no problem.
A family with a problem.
We're going to have to decide whether or not we're going to be able to solve the problem.
They were so surprised.
They picked that leaf and ate it.
They went to the village three times and asked for it.
It's all gone.
I've eaten all my food.
I couldn't read it all night.
He loves us all so much.
Everything that happened is good.
He always lets go of everything he came for.
Until you and your rat family are wiped out.
I don't have anything made of gold anymore.
The tiger died there.
They say there used to be one family.
A little farther.
Some of them have become tigers.
China's south side.
I bought it from the Chinese.
Some of them fled to the land of China over there.
He's up on Gold Mountain.
It's a copper mine.
The environment is destroyed because of digging for gold in the mines of Ur.
I'm sorry.
Tomorrow night, my neighbors are about to celebrate.
He tried to get away from the disease. He tried to escape to another village.
He's in the car. He's gone.
He drove down to Mid-Sunner.
(Laughter)
The kids want to eat fried bread.
He was selling bread.
The two brothers parted the bread and ate it.
Those sparrows saw an old man...
I searched until I found you.
He had another dream.
Let's eat some very delicious fruit.
I'd like to eat something very delicious for dinner.
That grown-up made rice so delicious...
My kids have beards.
That bird has a lot of hair.
A dress made of feathers.
I'll give you 10,000 chats.
12,000.
Sixty and twenty-seven hundred.
I'll go with you. I'll help you with your work.
That's what I always do. I pray.
But my mother didn't say anything.
On that north side of Catin.
He's arrived at Myanmar from China.
Foreign press.
My father will be in this country.
I'll give you half the country.
The King of the Nation.
It's our state of Katin.
The north side of Catin.
To strengthen the peace of the state and of the country.
The most beautiful girl in the world.
He's the strongest man in the world.
I need permission to come down again on the ground.
Political rights.
The people who are interested in politics.
The people and the government.
A lot of people lost their lives.
Myanmar and China.
The voice of the people.
People's rights.
We'll have to accept the public's opinion.
You know what?
We're not even in the river here.
Something that can be eaten.
A rat will bite your ass.
The monkeys have turned red on their butt till today.
That's why every dog's ass has turned black.
One alien man.
Foreign medicine.
- He's married in foreign clothes.
The kids were very surprised.
(Laughter)
I was just sitting there in surprise.
The story ends here...
The title of this story is "The Mother's Love."
It's the story that our ancestors told us when they slept with us.
Once upon a time, in a village.
He said it was a long time ago.
This is what people used to say.
The Vilmas haven't arrived here yet.
It's called "Long-Zee" in Burmese.
In the days of the Burmese kings,
To make Myanmar peaceful.
For the sake of many Myanmar people.
It's a political issue all over Myanmar.
When I opened my eyes,
You keep your eyes closed.
I'm always crying.
I can't see his face.
The look on your face when you were a little girl.
Nothing on my face, nose or mouth.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
The people of Katin cried too.
God wiped the tears of the Cinchins from my eyes.
The medium said...
I pretended to pray.
(Laughter)
It's a tree ripe with fruit.
And that's what we're trying to do.
When the abalone matures,
It's a very famous temple.
I named him a hero.
He said he got the name "power" at the end of the day.
We have to work together.
I don't think about it.
He was a little arrogant.
My children are smart.
The wise said to him:
Wise man, this fruit flows when I'm bathing.
I'm in Doucaton, Michiner.
I went back to Michiner City and sold it.
It's been a long time since I stopped going to Michiner.
When I went into town,
One small town...
Like Bamor, Michiner, the big city of Catin.
The Katin people.
We're Zin Po people.
All kinds of birds.
The history of the Catins.
I'm L. Sensy of the Jin-Possian Min-Mama.
And that's what I'm going to talk about today.
People who love our people.
I worked out of love for my people.
My brothers who love our country and our people.
It really happened.
It happened, so...
What I'm about to tell you is one of the things that happened back in the province of Shan.
I don't understand much.
You got knowledge and understanding.
You two have a very good understanding of each other.
My mother got sick and died.
I had a headache every day.
He's had a serious illness.
Mom, I can't see what I'm doing right now.
And when I look at him...
I didn't expect...
He's on a higher level.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
I've been picking up low levels of people.
Listen to me very carefully.
The tiger's gotta hear what he's saying.
I don't want to hear your children speak...
I threw up twice with a two-ton madawinnai ah.
Something happened to tear up my stomach.
It's been a long time since I've had dinner and I've had to get dizzy and throw up again, so...
Take the Spirit of Heaven.
I went to the spirit realm of heaven and joined Manau.
The daughter of the Spirit of Heaven is so angry.
When I heard the sound of mourning...
The cries of mothers crying.
He went there to mourn.
We're gonna get wet.
I've been wet all over.
I got wet and wet.
When I finish building the dam...
This dam has fallen...
He's seen the power of building a fish in a big river.
A company that the government supports.
Let's help our leader.
Support the orphanage.
I don't know why you showed it to me.
Show me the way.
Show me the knowledge I've given you to be rich.
The school is based on English.
It's an American-based Western organization based on basic human rights.
If you really understand the basics of the work you have to do and always try...
The landlord's grandmother.
Her husband loved her very much.
The land we own.
I went back at night.
Which direction would it correspond to?
One neighbor is poor, one is rich.
That's why I'm here.
In the hands of someone with authority.
The British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British, the British.
He's gone.
Make dinner first.
The more birds he got, the more happy he was.
- U ntsa kaw makap bai gap na she...
I covered it with leaves.
Open the lid and find everything you've got.
It'll break when it turns.
He ran off the road to Zigzag.
He was dishonest. He lied to me.
It's as big as an elephant's body.
Wild elephants, very bad elephants.
You give me ivory, you give me ivory, and I give you ivory.
Sometimes there was a war.
We called in a war. We fought.
We fought a war in their country.
Take a bath with the blue pepper.
When I boil, I put spices in it...
Thank you for welcoming me.
That's why I told you.
Why are you crying?
Because he believed in God.
This child is the king's real child.
You're not my real father.
Only true love will make us friends.
It's the only way you can't go without it.
I just wanted to go.
People said it the right way.
Takin is very heavy.
Fat kids are heavy.
You're old, you're heavy.
These stabs aren't clean.
You're talented.
Dogs don't have talent.
What kind of religion do you believe in?
He and his religion are different.
When there's no religion.
Watch your back.
A tree-protective spirit.
To save your life.
There's a kid named Mako sleeping near my brother.
Nearly where he's sitting.
When I was sitting by the river,
I need you to hide us both.
The deer hides in the woods...
He was hiding in a dry leopard.
When we get to the entrance of that lake...
When the chicken blows...
It's getting dark.
A very beautiful young woman.
Dragon girl.
He liked that young woman, so...
She sang a very pleasant song.
The song I sang.
The sound of young men and women singing.
I've collected the gold and silver he's got.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
I had a collection of Djinpo stories.
I got stuck in a tree trunk.
The fish that swallowed the hook.
You're welcome to contact me.
Special experience.
He's got a lot of experience.
To get a job experience.
When we get to that bridge...
I built a bridge between his house and the river Mari.
Why don't you go and dig under that bridge about the money?
I couldn't help but scratch my head.
I scratched him in the face with the man who pulled his foot.
The people who started it.
And I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm afraid I've been opposed to something illegal, so...
Don't forget that.
I said, "Don't talk." He forgot...
He fell asleep there.
He's one of the Youth League members.
(Laughter)
I'm going to tell you a little bit about what I'm going to talk about today.
Most of the people...
Something special that most people know.
Most of it has to come from overseas.
Three, four days, hungry.
She said she had four girls.
14 years, 15 years.
He dropped his gun and fled to the woods.
To the woods where there are no people.
There was no grass, no trees, no trees.
The Great Irrawaddy.
Where the Mari and the Nmme meet.
They say it was a long time ago, that there was a village at the confluence of the Mari River and the Unmie River.
I'm going home instead of my brother.
Instead of speaking Ginpopo, I spoke another language, so...
He changed his mind again.
You're an idiot.
I fell in love and went crazy.
She's become very beautiful.
One of our guests is back.
I went to live in someone else's house.
That's how the guests stayed.
I smelled it.
The tiger smelled like meat, so he wanted to eat it.
That flower smells good.
His friend said again.
The lady friend was so smiling...
Me and the monkey became friends.
I went there early in the morning.
In the morning...
You fed me very good breakfast.
Don't laugh.
When I met her with a smile,
Come on, everybody who can joke.
He has a lot of friends.
I've called a lot of friends.
They were friends, so...
The young men around him were very jealous of him.
Two very jealous friends.
It's like this because of jealousy.
Dance while you see the hawks flying.
It's one of the dancing dances with the three tuxes.
It's called "dancing the dance of death" when you're still filling the dead.
It's expensive.
It's worth a lot of money.
Time must be very important.
Let's go to Manau Festival.
It wasn't just a dance, it was just a dance.
So let's add 7 to both sides of this equation.
50 or 100,000.
Four, five times.
Forgive me for my mistakes.
He forgave his brother's sins without saying a word.
"I must die because of my mother," he blamed her.
It's a book by Dr. Maran LaLalow.
We are the Malan Pundus.
If the people of the Maran tribe become chiefs...
It's raining.
It's raining.
It's gonna be heavy rain.
Give me a picture.
I left it on a tree trunk.
The pebbles on this hill are very white.
I've called a lot of villagers...
The night I got there,
(Laughter)
It's the same with everyone.
Just like that, humans are wise.
As I said, half my country and my daughter.
I'm sorry.
That's where I went to buy some salt.
Mom, buy me something you like.
Two women went to the market and went home.
We're the Marip family.
The history of the Marip family.
Mr. Mop's Kumja Mahgam.
I missed my mother and my sister.
I missed my parents so much.
I could sing with a heart that missed home.
Tell me.
I need you to come back here.
I want you to pick some fruit.
When I screamed so hard,
He cried out in despair.
I went back to the village and I walked around screaming.
We're Ronwyers.
The Tamba people of Lonwar.
The old lady's house in Lonwar.
Three of them.
Four girls.
The family had five descendants.
It's not about politics. It's about politics. It's about politics.
And that's what we're trying to do.
A lot of trade practices.
The day I've decided...
When the time is up...
The flower of a registered people.
People who are impatient.
Bees got mad.
His mind is very good.
I picked up my desk.
He licked his feet.
There were three rich men.
The three of us are the king's children.
I hit a student three times.
You lied to me.
He pretended to be in pain.
The old woman pretended to be asleep.
Two men on the road.
My family is very rich and peaceful.
The Christians fed him.
I don't like dogs.
Mom, the snake licked me and swallowed me.
I went home and licked the salt in my house.
We're both poor.
I feel sorry for you.
She's over 80 years old.
At night, eight, nine o'clock.
When I'm seven or eight years old...
It's so dirty.
My whole body got dirty.
You're so annoying.
We remember this story to this day.
I don't remember the name of this fruit.
I remember writing.
That's what the priests told me to do.
He told me to take it one more time.
Just like HQ told me to do.
I've got pus.
I'll bring you both a gift.
You're a good family for us.
They both went out again to look for food.
I asked the village adults to judge this event.
It was rice that saved my mother's life.
May I continue?
But that's what I'm going to do every day, and that's what I'm going to do.
Yeah, I was wrong.
We'll give you a present.
Go to the bear tomorrow. Don't come to me.
Let's find the answer.
I gave you a very difficult answer.
I was disappointed that I couldn't answer the question.
Those people spit at him.
Every time I saw a manai tree, I spit.
I've always been to this trunk and spit.
I took the leaves of the medicine.
The old woman couldn't bite her, so...
They've become slaves to the old man.
Let's make slaves of those who don't listen to us.
Humans are us.
What do you want to eat?
I'm gonna close my eyes and go to sleep.
I spit on him.
I spit on him.
I spit in the tree.
We'll be close together.
I made friends with my friends in the village.
Last night's dream.
Last night, I danced to death.
I had a good night's rest last night.
I already told you yesterday.
There's a bottle I made yesterday.
Last year, we opened the warts I shot and ate them.
Not last year.
Last year, my late doctor.
I cut a snake's tail in the field I cut last year.
I can't hear you again.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear it raining?
I don't know if you can hear too much.
Rats have ears.
The elephant's ears are similar to those of a duck.
You can hear for a long time, sister.
He'll know.
He'll be very angry.
I'm going to make some money to build a family.
His parakeets.
Yes, yes, this is yours.
Let's not tell him about us.
From the age of our ancestors to the present.
He put the fruit back in the basket and carried it back.
And I felt sorry for her, and I held her so much, and I cried.
He went into the woods.
To one very deep forest.
There was a bear kid playing in the bush.
I picked the flowers again.
The flowers bloomed.
The vase's broken.
I ate fruit on a tree.
And that's when the fruit came out.
I sold the fruit.
Taste of the food.
It tasted sweet. It tasted good.
It tastes very good.
He did it himself.
I'm not going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it.
It's very old.
You two work very hard.
You two brothers don't go anywhere.
Every time you two fight, you hit each other.
Your parents and grandparents.
You people, the people who are doing the work.
You'll be saved.
Someone like you.
I'm not your child.
You're still very young.
Your child is so beautiful.
For your wife.
Where's your mother?
I set fire to the roof and roof.
We burned down villages in the mountains.
I burned those animals to death.
The spirit of the sun became a snake.
I don't care about him.
I thought the sin was so great.
I thought I said it with love.
The dragon of the lake.
That's where we're going.
I'm leaving now.
I wonder if the elephant king is still here.
I pray to God.
To pray and serve God.
I've been working at that church.
At night, hawks come down a little lower...
People with low levels.
I asked the Lord to feed me.
Around the mountains near the border.
It's a news station close to the government.
It's hard to go to Nogumun because it's too close to Putao.
It's someone else's.
People from the sun's land have returned...
Until today.
I'll come back tomorrow.
11:00am a.m. yesterday, 11 a.m.
Three, four years.
Let's dance for Manau this year.
How old are you now?
Let's pick a leader so that one of us from three will become a leader.
He was the first to shoot that more educated man with a bow and arrow.
I said, "No, I don't need it." So I said, "No, I don't need it."
He's a hero who has the courage to oppose people who don't use the law.
People who don't listen, who say they don't.
The light will be changing again.
I could wear this light.
Young men who will be leaders.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
I want you to be a leader.
He doesn't see and he doesn't hear and he doesn't see and he doesn't see and he doesn't hear.
You don't know what's going on. You don't know what's going on. You don't know what's going on.
Even though he is human, he has an animal heart...
Ask the government what they think.
Each different opinion.
It's the opinion that the Cinchins have to work together.
To the new house.
This bride and groom have built a family.
We'll build this new village.
(Laughter)
I can't find the origin of this great river.
First, God created the heavens and the earth.
I was looking for my assistant. I couldn't find her.
If I take out the Iron Axe...
I'll show you the silver axe again.
I was rich selling that gold ax.
One woman and one man built a family.
That woman suddenly turned into a dragon.
When I look at the beautiful lady of the bride...
A woman and a man.
There were two women in one of those desks.
I told my daughter.
I'm gonna stick to the roof, and I'm gonna break it.
I put it on the roof, and I burned it.
There's a monkey in the roof.
His soul became his mother's cow.
It's not like you're surprised and you're walking out of your soul.
The dust is so thick.
There's a lot of dust on that ladder.
The sky is filled with dust and ashes.
He's too busy at work.
There's not much oil.
Don't cry too much.
I saw a deer hanging on a tree.
Cut the rope hanging you.
I tied him to a branch of that tree and hung him.
I walked along the great river in Mari...
It's my mother's kid. What's this?
Seven rui. The parents of the spirits had seven girls.
I'm so sorry.
An old woman digs and eats.
Cooking water and fresh leaves...
Three brothers.
We two brothers are your children.
They're very much alike.
One unintelligible young man.
And that's what I'm going to do.
Think about it with the intelligence and the brains that God has given you.
My hometown.
My child.
I came here to see my child.
It's a tree that doesn't die.
The ground didn't get wet, so he died.
Some people have grown and grown, some have shrinked and disappeared.
The cat's gone.
Cats and dogs don't get along until today.
That black cat was stealing from a man's house and eating it.
They're doing their job.
One of the waterbirds was sitting there again.
May you always be with the good ones.
I told him I'd won.
He said, "I'm more tired."
You said you wanted to see me.
Very hard kind of rope.
It's a strong house.
Lasting peace.
He said, "I threw this pot away."
I said, "No way."
I thought he was smart.
It's only been one day.
Have you finished eating?
I'm done with my work.
You don't kill me yet.
I'm innocent.
I owe you this.
It's been a while since I've been in the woods this morning.
I heard the bird singing in that very faraway place.
Be gentle.
I walked slowly.
I only showed him the peace of mind.
There were only two of us left.
That's how he left his children.
Let's get you some leftovers.
I couldn't do my job.
Tiger children don't know anything.
Children shouldn't sit down.
Red cloth.
He's wearing a cloth.
Help me sew the cloth...
The wind blew so hard.
The wind is very strong.
His whole house was caught in the storm.
Let's pick you up at the airport.
Where the plane can land.
10dalam jawn yang du ii
I shot him with a bow.
I've learned how to bow and arrow.
People who can't do anything like this.
You have to go home and sleep again.
I don't think our brothers will survive this time.
The king announced it to their villagers.
It's a news report sent to the villagers.
The prince's cat is dead.
I've always given him power.
There are still people stronger than us.
That person is a very powerful spirit.
I've got one in my mouth.
Don't you know I threw goat shit into your mouth?
She's turned into a rainbow from the time the lightning struck.
Some of them are very lazy.
Some of it's straight.
I ate some bananas.
And all his beards were white.
The Spirit of the Nkhm.
I'll give you this medicine to your people.
We're the ancestors of Nkhum Tuyau.
(Laughter)
That hole he was digging, he died.
Look at the holes that are so deep...
He's a seeder.
I planted them with seed.
There are seeds, trees that bear fruit.
There was one stonestone.
The stone doors here were closed.
You pick up one stone and throw it...
It's got nine tails.
I hope you'll grow up like a horse's tail.
He pulls the backs of the tigers...
I'm going down again.
When he got drunk and woke up again,
There's something I want to tell you about the kite.
Take the bride's beauty.
Our first Manau.
When I first arrived at that house,
It was a long time ago, from the beginning to today.
All the foundations of heaven and earth are shaking.
It's a secret of knowledge and success.
I fell down.
I just happened to pass under it.
He was sitting under that tree.
I put the hedgehog in my bag and carried it.
I need you to lend me your bag to go to Manau Festival.
He put that wallet in his bag and went home.
The bamboo that the old woman stabbed
I don't know if anybody's here.
I don't know if that's better.
I wonder if my brother's here.
After we get into that village...
After going up the river...
I took it and then I threw it in the river.
You must draw your sword, too.
This isn't the kind that cuts with a sword.
I cut the trunk of the tree with a sword.
One day,
In the morning, when the light went out, the chickens rang.
I've got a fish bone stuck in my throat.
I broke his ribs and hit his lungs.
The river Ur flows from northeastern to northeastern, like a spinal cord in the middle of the Hiri mine.
I broke the corner and let it in.
They say dogs used to grow horns.
The female deer with long horns.
I breathed my breath out of his power.
My life is dead.
He's out of breath and he's dead.
His color is white.
The crow's color is gone.
His face doesn't look so happy anymore.
I heard the whistle.
I could hear the drum beat.
"What's the matter with you?"

I hid her navel.
A place where I buried my body.
It's the grass that grows from where I cut his cord and buried it.
I really want to talk to you.
I'll talk to him.
I called him back. We had a meeting.
The stars have shone.
I've counted the stars and played with them.

And I'm going to show you what I'm going to do in the next few years.
Where did he shoot the deer?
You're still gonna be okay.
To be able to endure.

At night, it's very hard to find a needle.
You're always doing your best...
And that's what I'm going to talk about today.
You're always putting equity in it.
Why are you crying?

It's a sincere word.
I'll tell you the truth.
A sincere, just man.
But he said, "I'll go."
He thought very much, no matter what.
He doesn't talk much at all.
(Laughter)
People in the village knew that she was possessed by a spirit.
She didn't have to do anything all day.

A cup full of grape juice.
Why don't you eat whatever you get from the vine?
We're going home.
He's already gone.
I'll come to your cabin and sleep.
When his soul came into him again,
(Laughter)
His friend's wife.
When my husband comes home from work, he's so tired...

Now I've changed my mind very much.
Three, four days.
It's the first time I've seen it.
They had one child.
Go and tell your mother and father.
They both slept with a tiger in their arms.
If you say, "Make way," she wouldn't open it.

The villagers all ate together and couldn't eat it.
In front of everyone.
All kinds of birds.
All our mistakes.
My mother was surprised to see that...
Yes, eat this fruit.
You've never seen anything like it.
My children will get their sins.
It's a very bad thing to be jealous.
Jesus Christ saved us from sin.
Why don't you help me?
I'm sorry.
You'll follow me slowly.
You're like a tiger lying on its back.
He's up, he's up, he's up, he's up, he's up, he's up, he's up, he's up, he's up, he's up, he's up.
When he woke up in the morning, he saw her dead.
He had another dream.
I dreamt I'd lend him a container.

It's been a long time since I've been here.
Heaven and earth are broken. The mountains are gone.
The village has been devastated. It's sad.
